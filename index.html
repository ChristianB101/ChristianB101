  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> My Name is Christian Bowen rising sophomore at Lincoln University of PA. Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY</p>
  <p>Growing up my mom tried her best to keep her sons out of the streets and active, weither it was placing us in martial arts, football, basketball or weekend clubs.</p>
  <p>I picked up the great activity of video games being heavily intrigued and appreciative of technology, video games brough me peace.</p>
  <p>Being able to talk to my friends from school and enjoy gaming was the best invention ever to 12 year old me. Until my mom had enough and signed me up for a coding course at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, NY</p>
  <p>The weekends was the only time I could play video games and having to wake up as early as 8am to go to code was cruel to me. At first coding was foreign and extremly difficult, random characters typed together </p>
  <p>The smallest mistake, a backslash compared to a slash could be the difference between a black screen and a working code. After trials and tribulations coding slowly became my passion.</p>
